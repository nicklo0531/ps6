##This data is from Kaggle and is about video game trends from 1980 to 2020. We are interested in video games, thus decided to investigate in it. I am in charge of the sales overtime of platforms. Therefore, I created a table and a plot in which the user is able to select the platform they are interested in and then visualize the trend of video games based on global sales over time.
